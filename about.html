                    <p> Dave started out as a blacksmith in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and his career found a winding
                        path through fabrication, construction and eventually managing projects in manufacturing and
                        software development. At one
                        point he was the lead prototype fabricator for an engineering laboratory doing research and
                        development for the Department of Defense, which is surprisingly similar to creating sculpture
                        to order.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There are very few processes and technologies he has not used at
                        some point and is passionate about learning new processes whenever possible.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When not making things with rocket scientists he plays music with rocket scientists as part of
                        Minor Mishap Marching Band.
