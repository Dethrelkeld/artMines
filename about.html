                        design-to-installation solution or
                        just fabrication, depending on your needs. Their strength is in our flexibility and the
                        experience
                        that enables it, allowing large and small orders across a wide range of technologies and

                        The Art Mines is an art duo of Mary and Dave, working from their studios in Austin, TX. Their
                        specialty is giving you the best quality, with consistency and with an easy interface. Mary and
                        Dave can do this because of the breadth and depth of expertise they bring from fine art oils and
                        large scale prop making to commercial manufacturing technology. Thatâ€™s why they are equally at
                        home with a single one-off piece or an order of 180 pieces.

                        Mary is originally from the San Antonio area and moved to Austin in 2012. In her personal work,
                        Mary's focus is on representational figurative oil painting. She has been a professional artist
                        for most of her life, selling her first oil painting in a show at age 14. She shows her work all
                        around Austin now and won Best in Show at the 2018 Georgetown Art Hop Juried exhibition in
                        Georgetown, TX.

                    <p>
                        In addition to being classically trained in oils, Mary also has a background as a scenic artist
                        working on theatrical sets, backdrops, and props. She taught Acrylic Art classes for 8 years and
                        has hosted oil and charcoal workshops for schools and collectives.

                        All of her combined experience and skills are the perfect mix for The Art Mines, making all
                        types of art full time.

                    <p> Dave started out as a blacksmith in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and his career found a winding
                        path through fabrication, construction and then managing projects in manufacturing and
                        software development. He was the lead prototype maker for an engineering lab doing
                        R&D for the Department of Defense, basically making and testing inventions in a mad
                        science laboratory which is surprisingly similar to making sculptures to order.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        He has used a wide variety of technologies and is passionate about learning new processes
                        whenever possible. Although starting
                        in metalworking, he has shifted his focus into fine woodworking, making fine art furniture and
                        is branching into software, composites and robotics. The sky is the limit as to what can be
                        made!

                    <p>
                        When not making things for rocket scientists he plays bari sax with rocket scientists as part of
                        the
                        Minor Mishap Marching Band in Austin, TX, and makes props, costumes and prototypes for fun.
